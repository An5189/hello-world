# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
My name is Angie. I'm here to learn how to use GitHub. 
I'm taking CS50x just because I love learning. 
I've always wanted to use GitHub but I never knew where to start.
I tried a few times and failed. I'm building a website and learning to code and I need GitHub so here I go again.
